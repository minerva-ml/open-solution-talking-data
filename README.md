# TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge: open solution

This is an open solution to the [TalkingData Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection).

## Goal
Deliver open source, ready-to-use and extendable solution to this competition. This solution should - by itself - establish solid benchmark, as well as provide good base for your custom ideas and experiments.

## Usage: Fast Track
1. clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-talking-data.git`
1. install requirements
1. register to [Neptune](https://neptune.ml/ 'machine learning lab') *(if you wish to use it)*
1. run experiment:
```bash
$ neptune login
$ neptune experiment send --config neptune.yaml --worker gcp-large --environment base-cpu-py3 main.py train_evaluate_predict --pipeline_name solution_1
```
collect submit from `/output/solution-1` directory.

## Usage: Detailed
1. clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-talking-data.git`
1. install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and `torchvision`
1. install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. register to [Neptune](https://neptune.ml/ 'machine learning lab') *(if you wish to use it)*
1. open [Neptune](https://neptune.ml/ 'machine learning lab') and create new project called: `talking-data` with project key: `TDAT`
1. run experiment:
```bash
$ neptune login
$ neptune experiment send --config neptune.yaml --worker gcp-large --environment base-cpu-py3 main.py train_evaluate_predict --pipeline_name solution_1
```
collect submit from `/output/solution-1` directory.
